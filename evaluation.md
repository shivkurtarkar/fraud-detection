## EDA (Max: 2 Points)
- [ ] **0 points**: No EDA
- [ ] **1 point**: Basic EDA (looking at min-max values, checking for missing values)
- [ ] **2 points**: Extensive EDA (ranges of values, missing values, analysis of target variable, feature importance analysis)

## Model Training (Max: 3 Points)
- [ ] **0 points**: No model training
- [ ] **1 point**: Trained only one model, no parameter tuning
- [ ] **2 points**: Trained multiple models (linear and tree-based). For neural networks: tried multiple variations â€“ with dropout or without, with extra inner layers or without
- [ ] **3 points**: Trained multiple models and tuned their parameters. For neural networks: same as previous, but also with tuning (adjusting learning rate, dropout rate, size of the inner layer, etc.)

## Exporting Notebook to Script (Max: 1 Point)
- [ ] **0 points**: No script for training a model
- [ ] **1 point**: The logic for training the model is exported to a separate script

**Score:** [Enter score here]

## Reproducibility (Max: 1 Point)
- [ ] **0 points**: Not possible to execute the notebook and the training script. Data is missing or it's not easily accessible
- [ ] **1 point**: It's possible to re-execute the notebook and the training script without errors. The dataset is committed in the project repository or there are clear instructions on how to download the data
