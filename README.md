## Overview

Fraud detection is a critical aspect of ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of transactions in industries like finance, e-commerce, and banking. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent.

The goal of the project is to create an automated fraud detection system that can predict fraudulent transactions based on historical data.

---

## Problem Statement

With the rise in online transactions, financial institutions face an increasing challenge of identifying fraudulent transactions. Fraudulent activities lead to significant financial losses, reputation damage, and legal consequences.

This project addresses the problem by building a machine learning model capable of automatically classifying transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent using historical transaction data.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset for this project is `fraudTrain.csv`, which contains transaction data with various features. These features are used to train the model to identify patterns associated with fraudulent behavior. The dataset includes:

- **Features**: Various transaction attributes, including transaction amount, customer data, and timestamps.
- **Labels**: The target column, where `1` indicates a fraudulent transaction and `0` indicates a legitimate transaction.

---

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to automatically detect fraudulent transactions. The project consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.
2. **Model Development**: Train and fine-tune various machine learning models.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate classification metrics.
4. **Deployment**: Deploy the model for real-time fraud detection.

## Setup

### 1. Model Development

#### a. EDA Setup
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, including the distribution of features and class imbalance.
- Visualize feature distributions, correlations, and outliers.
  
#### b. Training Model
- Train multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.) using the prepared dataset.
- Evaluate models based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Fine-tune the hyperparameters for better performance.

### 2. Deployment

#### a. Run Locally
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` and run the model on your local machine.
  
#### b. Run using Docker Compose
- Dockerize the application by using the `Dockerfile` and run the model using `docker-compose.yml` to manage services.

#### c. Run using Kubernetes
- Set up the environment using Kubernetes for scaling and managing the deployment.
- Apply the Kubernetes deployment configurations from the `kubernetes/` directory.

---
### 3. Build Deployment Using Makefile

To simplify the deployment process, use the `Makefile` to automate tasks such as building the Docker image, starting the Docker container, and deploying to Kubernetes. The commands inside the Makefile may look like this:

```makefile
build:       # Build Docker image
    docker build -t fraud-detection .

run:         # Run Docker container
    docker-compose up

deploy:      # Deploy to Kubernetes
    kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml
```

---

## Model Report

Once the model is trained, a detailed model evaluation report will be provided. The report includes:

- Model selection process
- Hyperparameter tuning results
- Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Model confusion matrix

You can view the detailed report [here](./model_report.pdf).

---

## Architecture

The architecture of the system involves the following key components:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned and transformed into a format suitable for model training.
2. **Machine Learning Model**: A model is trained using the dataset to detect fraudulent transactions.
3. **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using classification metrics to ensure it works accurately.
4. **Deployment**: The model is containerized and deployed using Docker and Kubernetes for scalability.
